Here the assignment question is - 

Lab 7: Layered Architecture

Refer the case study and create an application for that requirement by creating packages and classes as given below:
Case Study:

•	com.cg.eis.bean
	In this package, create “Employee” class with different attributes such as id, name, salary, designation, insuranceScheme.
•	com.cg.eis.service
This package will contain code for services offered in Employee Insurance System. The service class will have one EmployeeService Interface and its corresponding implementation class.
•	com.cg.eis.pl
This package will contain code for getting input from user, produce expected output to the user and invoke services offered by the system. 
On the basis of above case study implement a class to accept multiple employee details and store all employee objects in a Hashmap. The functionalities need to be implemented are as follows:

•	Add employee details to Hashmap.
•	Accept insurance scheme from user and display employee details based on Insurance scheme.
